ForgeEssentialsMain
===================
The Forge Essentials project consists of a permissions and protection system to be used with forge servers. This will have some WorldEdit functionality, but will not be designed to change the world as much as it is designed to select areas to protect. Think worldguard.

Setup
=====
Minecraft: 1.4.2  
MCP: 7.19  
Forge: #354

Get the latest Forge, MCP, and MC jars, and decompile. Once you have a working Forge workspace, pull the repo into that MCP folder.
When more than one contributor is online, we use Saros to collaborate.
