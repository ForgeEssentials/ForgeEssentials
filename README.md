ForgeEssentialsMain
===================
The Forge Essentials project consists of a permissions and protection system to be used with forge servers. It will replace worldedit and worldguard in functionality.

Setup
=====
Minecraft: 1.4.2  
MCP: 7.19

Get the latest Forge, MCP, and MC jars, and decompile. Once you have a working Forge workspace, pull the repo into that MCP folder.
When more than one contributor is online, we use Saros to collaborate.
