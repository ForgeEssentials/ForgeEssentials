A guide to getting your issues resolved by the FE dev team.

If you don't follow this guide, YOU WILL BE IGNORED.

Make shure you follow all of these steps:

	1) Make shure your ForgeEssentials is up to date, Link: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1592223-
		a) Every time you mention your issue, mention what version of FE you are using. If you use beta, TELL US!
	
	2) Make a debug log.
		a) Open "main.cfg".
		b) Make "verbose=true"
		c) Run the server.
		d) Make the error happen.
		e) Put the error on pastebin.
	
	2) Look at the Issue List on github, Link: https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentialsMain/issues
		=> If your problem is on github already:
			a) Feel free to add your experience to the existing issue.
			b) Make shure to include the link to Pastebin
			c) Write a little explanation. Just "My server crashes!" is not a error report.
			d) Feel free to join the IRC channel "#forgeessentials".

		a) Wait 30 sec.
		b) If your issue is mentioned, join the discussion.
		c) Ask about your problem.
		d) If told "Make an issue on github.". Go to step 4.
		e) If someone seems interested. Give them the link to pastebin.
		f) If you get no response. Ping (say the full name of) an OP (DO NOT PING LUACS)
		g) If you still get no response, Wait at least 5 minutes, while you are waiting, think about how to explain what errors.
		h) Still no response? Go to step 4.
	
	4) Make a github issue
		a) Make a clear title.
		b) Make a clear explanation.
		c) Make shure to include the link to pastebin.
