## Snooper.php ##

You can make your own connector or use the premade ForgeEssentialsQuery.class.php
The index.php is an example of how you should use the ForgeEssentialsQuery.
You need to make sure you include the: <code>key.key</code>.

The <code>get</code> funtion in ForgeEssentialsQuery has a field "data", that should be an array with at least 1 item called <code>id</code>.
That <code>id</code> will determine what response you will get. If a response needs a username or extra data, it will tell you.

Make sure you change the IP and port before you start telling me it doesn't work.
